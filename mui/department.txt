Departments
The departments at MUIDS favor a collaborative approach to instruction. Rather than treating each subject as distinct and separate, teachers at MUIDS work together to help students find common ideas across subjects, helping them develop a level of critical thinking and creativity needed to succeed in the 21st century.
