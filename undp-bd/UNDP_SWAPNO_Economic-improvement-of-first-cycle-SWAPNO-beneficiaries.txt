Summary of SWAPNO impact assessment
SWAPNO (Strengthening Women’s Ability for Productive New Opportunities) is a public works
based graduation model project targeting distressed and vulnerable rural women. The project not
only aims at lifting poor women out of poverty during the project period, but also help them sustain
with a higher income level after the end of project support. While the first part is relatively easy due
to high wage income, the second part of sustainability of project outcomes requires additional
interventions. SWAPNO, following global best practices, complements public works with mandatory
and voluntary savings, training on life skills & livelihoods and linkages with local markets and
potential employers. The idea is that the set of skills learnt from training will help beneficiaries
invest their savings for productive purposes, which would yield a stream of income in years to come.
A baseline survey of 1200 households was carried out prior to project implementation in order to
establish the pre-project socio-economic conditions of the poor women. Bangladesh Institute of
Development Studies conducted a study at the end of the first cycle of beneficiary women to capture
project impact, using the same sample. The method of Randomised Control Trial with a control group
was employed, to ascertain the attribution of the project to results.
The endline study found that guaranteed wage employment for 18 months, complemented by returns
from investment in productive assets, has increased household income substantially for the
participating households. This has enabled a large share of beneficiaries to move out of abject poverty.
It has also led to an improvement of their social status, self-esteem and confidence, as well as their
aspirations for a better life in future. Such non-income outcomes are believed to help beneficiaries
sustain their high income and overall well-being beyond the project.

95% of the beneficiary and control group households were
extreme poor at baseline. The income of SWAPNO women
increased more than three times and this has reduced the
incidence of poverty. The endline survey shows that only
28% of the beneficiary women are now below the extreme
poverty line. This figure is still very high in the control group,
around 81%. Estimates show that about 52% reduction of
extreme poverty can be attributed to SWAPNO. This has
been brought about by an increase in yearly income of about
40,000 Taka attributable to the project.

Annual expenditure of beneficiary households increased by around 20,000 Taka. They spent
substantially more than the control group on food, clothing and especially education. All these
increases are attributable to SWAPNO. The beneficiaries are now more food secure as the share of
households skipping one or two meals has dropped. Around 55% of beneficiary households take three
meals a day. Three out of four SWAPNO households can now afford acceptable diet diversity, as
against only 36% at baseline and 55% of control group households currently. Beneficiary households
spend about 3,320 Taka on food per month, which is 1,000 Taka more than baseline. Of this increase,
around 450 Taka can be attributed to SWAPNO.

The end line study found significant
increase in assets of the beneficiaries. The
total value of their assets, excluding
homestead land, has increased more than
six times – and at the time of the survey
half of the women had not yet invested
their graduation bonus in assets.

Most of the beneficiaries were found to
have invested in livestock, poultry and
other productive assets. Livestock has

beneficiaries now. Not just the amount,
but the composition of asset has changed as well - livestock constitutes about 43% of their total assets,
which was only 13% before SWAPNO. The graduation bonus has also helped the beneficiaries access
agricultural land as they are leasing land.

On average, mean value of livestock for beneficiary households increased from around 2,000 Taka at
baseline to about 21,000 Taka in endline. Some 16,000 Taka increase in value of livestock can be
attributed to SWAPNO. In case of poultry, the value of assets has increased from about 400 Taka to
around 1,800 Taka and the project’s contribution is about 1,300 Taka.
There has been a drastic change in the composition of household assets from baseline to endline.
Livestock now constitutes 43% of total assets of beneficiary households, and this was only 13% before
SWAPNO. Household durables made up about 54% of total assets, in both treatment and control
groups, at baseline. This composition is significantly changed through the SWAPNO intervention.
Although SWAPNO households could afford to double the value of such durables, their share of total
assets has actually declined to 19%. This shift in composition of assets from unproductive to
productive assets is a life-changing event for the beneficiaries, with significant implications for the
sustainability of the outcome of the project.
The proportion of women reporting greater control over own income and assets has significantly
increased. Around 91% of SWAPNO women, as against 80% of women in the control group, reported
to have full control over their property. The women reported higher decision-making ability in income
generating activities, with SWAPNO contributing a 53% increase in the share of women empowered
to such decision making. Their ability to take decisions on their own will help sustain their income in
the absence of project support. Significant improvement was also observed in their mobility outside
home, aiding access to markets and service providing institutions as a result of project participation.
Beneficiaries have through the project intervention become more resilient to shocks. They are better
able to cope with disasters with their own assets, particularly their savings. The SWAPNO women
appear to be highly optimistic about the future and express significantly higher optimism about
achieving their future goals, as well as a capacity for realisation of these goals.

Progress of SWAPNO Beneficiary
•
•

Each beneficiary of 1st Cycle received BDT 88,600 as wage of which BDT 22,150 received as
mandatory savings at end of the employment tenure.
Market driven livelihood support is helping them to escape extreme poverty. It has been
observed from the follow-up data after one and half year, the average household income is
sustained and continued the upward trend. At the end of project cycle in June 17, the average
monthly income of 1st batch beneficiary was BDT 5,631 and after one and half year in
November 2018 it was found BDT 5,902 indicating sustained improvement of income.

TIMELINE

From the second month of employment with SWAPNO, beneficiaries started Rotating Savings
and Credit Association (ROSCA) within the group. Totally 640 Rotating Savings and Credit
Associations (ROSCA) were formed in Kurigram and Satkhira among 8,928 women
beneficiaries. In total BDT 7.6 crore savings were accumulated as of December 2018. Each
beneficiary women received at least BDT 7200 each from the accumulated savings. Utilizing
ROSCA and other savings, all beneficiaries started different Income Generating Activities
(IGAs) along with their regular employment in public assets maintenance work. The most
frequently operated IGAs of 2nd cycle beneficiaries are Goat Rearing, Small Business, Cow
Rearing, Fish Culture, Poultry Rearing, Tailoring, Rice business and Grocery.

•

The Income Generating Activities (IGA) follow-up data of 1st cycle beneficiaries show that
average capital investment has increased over the period. The average IGA capital of 1st cycle
beneficiaries were Tk. 19.7 thousand after the end of project cycle in June 2017 and in
November 2018 the average capital size was found Tk. 23.9 thousand. It reveals that SWAPNO
beneficiaries are improving their productive asset base even after one and half year.
