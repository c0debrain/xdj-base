Narratives
This progress report highlights the significant achievements of the SWAPNO IP project during the first half of the year (January
to June 2023), in accordance with the Annual Work Plan (AWP) - 2023. The project continued its operation based on the approved
Initiation Plan (IP) till June 2023. Subsequently, the IP period was extended for three months until September 30, 2023. During
this reporting period, the project has made substantial progress by accomplishing most of the planned activities. The project
has completed a feasibility assessment for the next phase. The Revised Detailed Project Proposal (DPP) and Project Document
(ProDoc) have been submitted to the Economic Relations Division (ERD) for three years up to June 2026. However the project
has been providing followup support to 3564 women beneficiaries even after completion of the project cycle who are engaged
with more than one Incoe Generating Activities (IGAs) and contributing to the houshlds income. Moreover, preparatory tasks
have been diligently carried out simultaneously during the IP period, facilitating the project to promptly initiate field
implementation immediately after receiving approval for the DPP from the Government of Bangladesh.
The following results/immediate results have been achieved during this reporting period:
Feasibility Assessment conducted for SWAPNO Phase II: To design SWAPNO next phase, the project conducted a need
assessment study of poor and extreme poor households in the poverty-prone and climate-vulnerable areas in Bangladesh. The
feasibility assessment was conducted in seven districts, namely Bagerhat, Gopalgonj, Chandpur, Sherpur, Pirojpur, Cumilla, and
Rangpur, which are dispersed across six different administrative divisions. The districts were selected based on their poverty
level and climate vulnerability index. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were followed for conducting the assessment.
Feasibility Assessment Major Findings:
• The study's findings suggest that widowed and divorced women are particularly vulnerable in study areas compared to
other groups. The data reveals that in poor and extremely poor households, only one person on average is engaged in
income-generating activities, and they tend to participate in 1.5 types of such activities. The study also shows that 71% of

4

•
•

•

•

•

households have an average monthly income of BDT 5000 or less, significantly lower than the national average income.
Around 19% of respondents reported a monthly average income within the BDT 5,001 to 8,000 range, while approximately
10% of households reported an income over BDT 8,000. It has been observed that most respondents are involved in
activities that do not require specific prior knowledge or skills.
The study found that households living in extreme poverty often experience long periods of unemployment each year,
during which they may borrow money from external sources to support their families.
The study found many good practices in all locales utilizing local resources, for example, using coconut or betel nut coir
(Bagerhat/Pirojpur area), small-scale vegetable production at homestead level, vegetable cultivation using sack method,
vermin compost preparation (all over the country), Duck farming (in haor, baor or ox-bow lakes); Net fishing (waterlogged
area); rainwater harvesting for safe drinking water (In saline area); crab cultivation (in the extreme saline area), etc. These
good practices may promote further ultra-poor women-led households.
Both poor and ultra-poor households have access to credit from NGOs, but to obtain this credit, they need to provide
weekly installments, which they repay through their daily income. The study findings revealed that the same households
took credit from different NGOs that worked in their locality. However, despite having access to credit facilities from NGOs,
it appeared from the discussions and community visits that ultra-poor households are still in a vicious circle and unable
to break the poverty line or escape extreme poverty.
Around 86% of respondent households have experienced natural disasters at least three times in the last five years.
Qualitative information gathered from focus group discussions, group discussions, and key informant interviews indicates
that the major climate hazards and disasters are cyclones, floods, flash floods, tidal surges, riverbank erosion, salinity,
waterlogging, drought, and lack of drinking water.
The study found that in certain pockets (Indurkani Upazila in Pirojpur District), some individuals may hesitate to engage
women in public works such as earthen road repair, road maintenance, construction activities, etc. Therefore, the project
should carefully consider selecting women beneficiaries or offering alternative work options if they are not interested in
participating in public works.

The findings and recommendations from the needs assessment will be implemented during SWAPNO's next phase.
ProDoc prepared and submitted to ERD: Based on the need assessment study's findings and the previous phase's successful
outcomes, the project aims to expand its reach to twelve impoverished and climate-vulnerable districts in Bangladesh. The
project has meticulously developed the ProDoc and Detailed Project Proposal (DPP) as per UNDP’s prescribed format as well as
the Planning Commission of the Ministry of Planning, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. The project received
recommendations and suggestions from relevant ministries to enhance the documents. After revising them, both the ProDoc
and DPP were submitted to the Economic Relations Division (ERD) under the Ministry of Finance, Government of Bangladesh.

Once the DPP receives approval, SWAPNO II will initiate field-level activities in Bangladesh's twelve poorest and climatevulnerable districts. The primary objective of this intervention is to uplift 10,188 ultra poor households out of poverty by June
2026.
Digital Application Developed for Phase II Beneficiaries: The project has developed a digital application (Android app) to
streamline the beneficiary selection process for the upcoming phase. The objective is to conduct 100% digital selection of the
beneficiaries in the next phase. In June 2023, the project conducted a pilot test of the beneficiary selection app in the field, and
it demonstrated excellent functionality and effectiveness as a targeted beneficiary selection method. As a result, the digital
application will be utilized in the beneficiary selection process for the next phase of SWAPNO, ensuring an efficient and
transparent selection process for all stakeholders involved.
Enterprise Accounts Management Software Developed: The project has successfully developed account management
software to track enterprises' business progress. The Enterprise Account Management System (EAMS) has been specifically
designed to assist small enterprises in managing their business functions through a centralized and integrated system.
Entrepreneurs can conveniently input their day-to-day business, operational, and logistic information, as well as transactions,
into the web-based EAMS software. This allows for streamlined data management and provides a comprehensive overview of
their business activities. Additionally, the system empowers administrators to effectively oversee all enterprises and gain insights
through comprehensive reports, guiding them in making informed business decisions.
Production of Milk chilling plant: The milk chilling plant of the SWAPNO project in Kurigram District has delivered outstanding
results during this reporting period. A remarkable total of 1,971 kgs of cheese and 40.7 kg of ghee were successfully produced,
predominantly sold right after production, amounting to a total worth of BDT 1391,405 (USD 13,914).
Production of Water Treatment Plant: The Water Treatment Plant (WTP) of the SWAPNO project in Gaibandha District made
significant strides in providing safe drinking water to the local community, addressing their limited access to safe water. In this
reporting period, approximately 300 households were able to conveniently access safe drinking water at a minimal cost through
the cooperative. A total of 117,580 liters of water, with a value of BDT 109,110 (USD 1,091), was successfully produced and made
available at an affordable price during this period. The success of this model has led to its replication by the Lalmonirhat district
administration as a cooperative enterprise. Furthermore, in line with its commitment to environmentally friendly practices, the
Water Treatment Plant operates using solar energy, making it a green initiative.

Production of Sanitary Napkin: "Kallyani Nari Kollyan Samittee," a women-led cooperative established during the earlier phase
of the SWAPNO project, it demonstrated remarkable success by continuing to thrive beyond the completion of project cycle. In
the current reporting period, SWAPNO has been providing ongoing support to sustain the cooperative's success. Through their
diligent efforts, the women-led cooperative has successfully produced and sold 18,240 packets of sanitary napkins. These
products have been distributed through various buying and selling points, clinics, and pharmacies in their local area, resulting
in a noteworthy revenue of BDT 820,800.00 (USD 8,208). For the women entrepreneurs, the cooperative's dedication served as
an encouraging model of economic empowerment and sustainability.
Developed Training module : In this reporting period, the project has developed a comprehensive Plastic Waste Management
training module for all the project participants including UDMC members, women beneficiaries, partner NGO staffs and union
workers in the 283 Union Parishads under 12 districts to demonstrate the circular economy (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle) of
plastic waste management. The project will train the women beneficiaries on collecting, sorting and recycling plastic waste from
their respective areas, including PET bottles and polyethylene. Through this recycling initiative, beneficiaries will have the
opportunity to create entrepreneurial ventures and generate additional income.
Vermicompost production and use: Despite the completion of the project cycle in the previous phase, SWAPNO beneficiaries
in four districts (Jamalpur, Gaibandha, Lalmanirhat, and Kurigram) have continued their vermicompost production and
successfully produced 20,841 kg (20.8 metric tons) of vermicompost. This organic fertilizer holds a market value of BDT
250,092.00 (USD 2,500.9). The beneficiaries' sustained production and sale of vermicompost demonstrate their entrepreneurial
skills and commitment to sustainable and organic agriculture practices.
Developed Business model on Plastic Recycling Plant: To establish one plastic recycling enterprise on a pilot basis, a
comprehensive business model is developed on effectively collecting, sorting, washing, and recycling the used PET bottles and
polythene bags in the plastic recycling plant. Through demonstrating the circular economy on plastic waste management, small
and medium-scale enterprises will be developed that will help to increase beneficiaries’ income levels.
Operational Manual Revised: Drawing upon the insights gained and lessons learned during the previous phase, the project
has thoroughly revised the existing operation manual in preparation for the next phase. This revised operational manual will
serve as a comprehensive guide for the successful execution of project activities during the upcoming phase. Currently, the
manual is in the final stage of refinement and is undergoing the process of finalization and printing.

7

Staff Foundation Training Module Developed: The project has designed a comprehensive staff foundation training module
spanning four days for the upcoming phase. This module will serve as a crucial training resource for the project staff, enabling
them to acquire essential skills necessary for conducting participatory training effectively. The training sessions will be highly
interactive and practice-oriented, focusing on enhancing the staff's abilities in facilitation, communication, and participatory
training techniques. Moreover, the training module will cover key topics such as project implementation strategies and an
extensive focus on delivering training based on the eight modules specifically designed to empower SWAPNO women
beneficiaries.
Project Scrutiny Committee (PSC) meeting held: The PSC meeting was held at LGD on 22 January 2023 where Hon'ble LGD
Secretary Mr. Muhammad Ibrahim, Dr. Md. Sarwar Bari, Director General of M&E Wing, LGD, Mr. Prasenjit Chakma, ARR of UNDP,
Mr. Habibur Rahman, NPD of SWAPNO project and Mr. Kajal Chatterjee, NPM of SWAPNO project discussed the planning and
implementation mechanism of SWAPNO's second phase.
Project Evaluation Committee (PEC) meeting held: The PEC meeting took place on June 12, 2023, using the "Zoom Platform."
The meeting was chaired by Mrs. Nasima Begum, the esteemed Senior Secretary of the Department of Socio-Economic
Infrastructure (SEI) at the Planning Commission, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. Government officials from
various ministries participated in the meeting. During the session, Mr. Habibur Rahman, National Project Director of the
SWAPNO project, provided an overview of the project's accomplishments in the previous phase and presented the plans for the
proposed next phase. Everyone expressed their appreciation for the positive results obtained so far and recommended
leveraging the lessons learned from the previous phase in the upcoming phase. The chairperson suggested incorporating all the
suggestions and recommendations from the meeting into the revised Detailed Project Proposal (DPP) and sharing it with the
relevant ministry for further action.
Project site visits: During this reporting period, representatives from UNDP Bangladesh, Donor agencies, and IMED visited the
project. While the project's field implementation for the earlier phase has been completed, numerous activities are still
continuing by the beneficiaries themselves, even after the completion of the project cycle. The visitors observed the present
situation of the SWAPNO beneficiaries and engaged in discussions with local women entrepreneurs such as owners of BuyingSelling points, Vermicompost producers, Sanitary Napkin producers, Water Treatment Plant operators, Milk Chilling Plant
operators, and others. Additionally, they interacted with community members and officials from the district level Government
of Bangladesh (GoB). The team expressed great satisfaction upon witnessing the remarkable results achieved through the
project's activities.

Feasibility Assessment conducted for SWAPNO next
phase.
D. Gender [mandatory for GEN2 and GEN3 projects]
SWAPNO phase II is designed to focus on the core mandate to ensure gender equality and women empowerment. Gender
issues will be effectively mainstreamed across all programmatic approaches. The SWAPNO II beneficiaries will be no longer
viewed as socially excluded women but as participants in a government programme. The project will contribute to gender
equality by empowering the women beneficiary groups to make personal, family, and community decisions through economic
activities. It is expected that the project will enhance women's empowerment, self-confidence, and agility. The project's
targeted 10,188 beneficiaries which are 100% women. The gender mainstream indicators are addressed in the project
document's Result Resource Framework (RRF). Gender disaggregated information will be gathered, analyzed, and stated in
the progress report.
E. Leave No One Behind (LNOB) [if any]
The project will select 100% excluded rural women (age 18 to 45) who are unable to earn and maintain a family. Based on
project beneficiary guidelines, SWAPNO II will give priority to select excluded rural women who are widowed, abandoned,
divorced, separated, or have a husband with a disability. The project has developed a digital application (Android app) to
streamline the beneficiary selection process for the upcoming phase. The objective is to conduct 100% digital selection of the
beneficiaries in the next phase. The project will actively engage community members, local journalists, NGOs, and Upazilalevel government officials to monitor the entire process. Finally, Union Parishad (UP) will approve the beneficiary list for
employment.
F. Innovation (if any)
Since SWAPNO II is in the planning stage, the project will apply the previous learning during the field implementation. In the
last phase, SWAPNO applied various innovative approaches i.e Climate Resilient Vegetable Cultivation using the sack method,
vermicompost production, women-led buying and selling points, Water Treatment Plant, Milk Chilling Plant, women-led group
farming, and micro health insurance for women. SWAPNO II has a plan to replicate such innovation in the new working districts
which was very successful in previous phase. Moreover, the project has a plan to establish one plastic recycling plant as pilot
basis for effectively collecting, sorting, washing, and recycling the used PET bottles and polythene bags in the plastic recycling
plant.
