1. INTRODUCTION
Bangladesh has been registering impressive economic growth and progress in human development
over the past decade. Despite achievements, vulnerable employment, as well as increased frequency
and intensity of disaster and climate risks are stalling further development. The COVID-19 pandemic
has posed an additional socio-economic challenge to Bangladesh, exacerbating inequalities and
pushing millions of people into poverty. Women belonging to the poverty pockets are bearing the
brunt of these complex challenges. The pandemic has mainly had gendered impacts, halting or even
reversing much of the progress in gender equality.
Strengthening Women’s Ability for Productive New Opportunities (SWAPNO) is a gender-based
social security project that targets ultra-poor rural women who are widowed, divorced, abandoned,
or left with a disabled husband unable to earn an income. SWAPNO has gathered knowledge and
insights into how women can slip back into poverty owing to malnutrition, climate vulnerability,
gender-based violence, and other factors since its inception.
SWAPNO follows a "state-of-the-art" graduation model that incorporates livelihood promotion,
financial inclusion, social protection, and social empowerment. For 15 months, the women are
employed by the Government. Simultaneously, participants receive training in self-confidence,
leadership, financial literacy, basic numeracy, saving, and spending. Following this, they receive
livelihood training based on their interests and local market opportunities to start micro-businesses
or find formal employment. They can access capital to invest in their businesses after completing
their employment term.
So far, SWAPNO has benefited 12,492 beneficiaries in five districts – Satkhira, Kurigram, Jamalpur,
Lalmonirhat, and Gaibandha districts. The project has helped highly vulnerable women in poverty to
develop their skills, linked them with services and the local markets, and ensured their financial
inclusion. This has secured their livelihoods and increased their resilience to shocks. The following
map illustrates the project’s intervention areas.

1.1

Project Outline

SWAPNO has six outputs concentrated on public works-based poverty graduation approach;
improvement of human capital; promotion of women empowerment; resilient livelihoods; promotion
of digital financial system; and strengthening of local government institutions for sustaining
SWAPNO impacts. Based on these six outputs, relevant indicators are defined, and progress are
measured as stated in section 2. Project’s outputs and major focusing areas of each output are stated
below:
Output 1: Core beneficiaries are able to protect their food security and livelihoods post-project.
Focusing areas:
• Selection of extreme poor women as core beneficiaries, maintain rural earthen roads and other
public assets.
• Employment of extreme poor women in public works and wage payment.
• Promotion of savings habits, skill training of extreme poor women for economic opportunities
and post-project employment.
• Promotion of expanded household asset base for sustainable livelihood development.
• Job placement arrangement with local SMEs and formal sector employment.
• Creation of social capital in support of graduated women and their post-project livelihood
activities
The purpose of these areas was to permanently move out the core beneficiary households from abject
poverty. Beneficiary households were assisted with critical thresholds, market linkage, and
employment opportunities that they did not have earlier.
Output 2: Core beneficiaries and their dependents have improved their human capital in terms
of nutrition, health, education, and voice
Focusing areas:
• Life skills training of extreme poor women.
• Nutrition and awareness campaign.
• Mobility and decision making of women.
• Awareness development and support during crisis.
The purpose of these intervention areas was to develop human capital that build confidence and
awareness, boost resilience to shocks and adverse trends, revert previous social exclusion, and thwart
inter-generational transmission of poverty.
Outputs 3: Core beneficiary households have access to public services essential for their
livelihood activities and family well-being.
Focusing areas:
•
•
•
•
•

Participatory identification of needs for services.
Establishment of linkages between service providers, in particular Upazila service providing
departments, and SWAPNO beneficiary households and other poor households in
participating local communities.
Enhancing cooperation between the UPs and service delivery departments.
Provision of savings deposit facilities with participating in financial institutions.
Provision of micro-insurance and access to digital financial services.

These interventions aimed to improve poor households’ access to essential services and improve the
quality-of-service delivery. These interventions enhanced cooperation between the UPs and service
delivery departments which created positive results in the livelihood activities of the core beneficiary
households.
Output 4: Public assets promoting economic growth, improving social conditions and
enhancing environmental conditions are maintained and developed for the benefit of the poor
of the participating rural communities.
Focusing areas:

•
•
•
•
•

On-the-job training to crew groups on techniques of quality maintenance work and wage
payments.
Provision of supplies (tools, tree saplings, uniforms, cell phones, etc.).
Monitoring, follow up support and supervision of the work and its quality.

The purpose of these interventions was to maintain and develop public assets central to local
communities’ economic and social life and special relevance for the rural poor.
Output 5: Local communities have a better capacity to withstand natural disasters and recover
after disasters
Focusing areas:
• Community engagement, consultation, awareness development and climate resilience
cultivation/technology use.
• Selection of poor women to develop/maintain environment friendly fertilizer/vermicompost
production.
• Developed, maintained and restored household/community assets that reduced the risk of
natural disasters.
• Enterprise development and Local employment creation for poor women.
These special set of interventions had the purpose to address the challenges and vulnerabilities posed
by climate change and reduced risk association with natural disasters. Schemes included rising the
height of the existing embankments, rehabilitating and raising the homestead of the vulnerable
households, awareness raising and climate resilient technology use, enterprise development and local
employment creation.
Output 6: Local Government has the capacity to implement social transfer projects with
accountability, transparency, gender sensitivity, and a pro-poor approach.
Focusing areas:
• Operation Manual development and implementation.
• Capacity development training, on-the-job coaching/training to UPs/UDMCs.
• Coordination meeting, workshops/lesson learning workshops conduction.
• Ownership development of UPs/UDMCs
• Baseline survey, midterm review and end-line survey conduction.
The purpose of these intervention was to develop the capacity of UPs/UDMCs, evidence-based
documentation, prepare evaluation reports, and promote good governance in implementing social
transfer programmes and pro-poor service delivery with respect to accountability, responsiveness and
inclusive development.
1.2
Context
SWAPNO (Strengthening Women’s Ability for Productive New Opportunities) is a gender-based
social security project targeting ultra-poor rural women 18-50 years of age who are widowed/
divorced/abandoned or left with a disabled husband. SWAPNO is implemented by the Local
Government Division (LGD) and UNDP under the auspices of the National Social Security Strategy
(NSSS) of the Government of Bangladesh. The overall objective is “Economic growth is achieved in
a more inclusive manner, with economic opportunities reaching rural poor women, and vulnerable
groups are protected against shocks”.
In recent years, Bangladesh has achieved significant socio-economic progress. The country is
expected to graduate from the group of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) by 2024. Despite
achievements, Bangladesh ranks 133 out of 189 countries on the 2020 Gender Inequality Index
(Human Development Report, 2020). Structural inequalities such as biased gender relations,
inadequate legal provisions, and weak governance complicate further progress on women’s

empowerment. Poverty also drives gender-based discrimination as it determines households’
decisions about how to use scarce resources.
Again, Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries worldwide regarding climate change and
disaster risks. These risks aggravate multidimensional poverty among women in the country as their
capacity to adapt to climate change is limited. To lift these women from the poverty trap, the Local
Government Division of Bangladesh and UNDP initiated the Strengthening Women’s Ability for
Productive New Opportunities (SWAPNO) project, focusing on ensuring the socio-economic
independence of Bangladesh’s rural women.
In 2015, SWAPNO spearheaded its activities in two districts: Kurigram and Satkhira. In 2019, it was
further extended to three impoverished districts of Bangladesh – Jamalpur, Lalmonirhat, and
Gaibandha. So far, the project has uplifted 12,492 distressed rural women out of extreme poverty.
SWAPNO has been recognized as a promising model for eliminating poverty at the National Social
Security Conference 2019. It has been suggested in the Government’s National Social Security
Strategy (NSSS) Action Plan to scale up the project across 200 Upazilas (or sub-districts). These
indicate high national ownership and increase the project’s potential to be further organized within
an integrated structure of ministries that can help maximize development impact.
2. PROJECT RESULTS & ACHIEVEMENTS
SWAPNO project effectively contributes to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 1,
2,3,5, 8, 10 and 13: No poverty, zero hunger, good health & well-being, gender equality, decent work
& economic growth, reduced inequalities, and climate action by implementing several initiatives like
public works programme, micro-enterprise development, training on Health & Nutrition, Climate
change, Gender, Formal sector employment, etc. This could be justified by comparing various wellbeing indicators like changes in income, expenditure, assets, dietary improvement and status of
nutrition, empowerment, etc. over time across the beneficiary and control groups. Our study findings
strongly support this statement as well. In terms of per capita income, consumption expenditure, and
asset holding, the SWAPNO project beneficiaries are ahead of the control households.
The project is in line with the NSSS; this social protection program leverages public works to train
vulnerable women in vocational skills, places them in productive employment, and supports them in
moving out of poverty. SWAPNO contributes to Bangladesh’s national and global level commitment.
On the national level, it promotes an inclusive and equal opportunity workforce, including increasing
women’s labor force participation. On the global level, the project reflects Bangladesh’s commitment
to eradicating extreme poverty as part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The project has consciously invested in “Ownership Building” with the Local Government Division,
District and Upazila Administration, and the Union Parishad (UP) in various ways. These include
extensive reporting, briefing, and meetings; involving the Local government officials in decision
making, accounts operation, and day-to-day management of project operation. The Central account
is operated jointly by the National Project Director (NPD) and the National Project Manager (NPM),
the district account is jointly used by the Deputy Director of Local Government (DDLG) and District
Manager (DM), while three signatories operate the UP account: the UP Chair, Chairperson of the
concerned Standing Committee-a female member of UP and the Secretary.
Using a rigorous beneficiary selection process, the project has selected impoverished, single femaleheaded rural households where the women are widowed/ divorced/ separated/ abandoned/ having
disabled husbands. The project disseminated information on beneficiary selection criteria, date, time,
and venue in the selected unions. Community members, local journalists, NGO, and Upazila level
government officials supervised the selection process. Finally, Union Parishad approved the final list
of project beneficiaries. Because of the transparency and active involvement of all stakeholders, 96%
beneficiaries are correctly targeted.

SWAPNO beneficiaries in the formal sector successfully sustain their jobs in the RMG and Leather
factories. The formation of the cooperatives by the beneficiaries and registration with the government
bodies have given a new dimension to local job creation and sustainable graduation. Also, it is
observed that beneficiaries are actively involved in more than two types of income-generating
activities even after the project completion. According to BIDS endline evaluation, they have
outperformed in terms of all major indicators of economic well-being compared with the control
group households.
Result 1: SWAPNO beneficiaries’ households have improved their living standard
Through access to employment, skill training and savings practices, the SWAPNO beneficiaries have
empowered themselves economically. The 3rd cycle endline evaluation report 2022 of BIDS, revealed
that the average annual income of beneficiary households stood near about double (BDT 177,387)
USD 2,086) compared to the control group (BDT 100,634 or USD 1,183). SWAPNO beneficiary
households’ expenditure and savings have increased through the project intervention. Presently, the
beneficiary households monthly average expenditure is almost three times higher (BDT 9,827 or
USD 115.6) compared to the
base situation (BDT 2,901or
USD 34). Moreover, the
productive asset value of
beneficiary
households
increased
dramatically
compared to the control group.
The current average productive
asset value of the beneficiary
household is BDT 160,299
(USD 1,886) and the control
group is BDT 101907 (USD
1,199). The average monthly
savings
of
beneficiary
households is more than seven
times higher than that of the
control group. Current monthly savings of beneficiary households is BDT 1132 (USD 13), and the
control group is BDT 142 (USD 1.7).
The results were achieved because the project rightly selected the targeted beneficiaries (96% correct
targeting), engaged them in public work schemes, provided life skills and livelihood development
training, and finally involved them in different Income Generating Activities (IGAs). The project
evaluation report revealed that SWAPNO beneficiaries have yearly project income around 57,600
BDT through wage employment. Along with the wage employment, SWAPNO project also enables
their beneficiaries to start Rotating Savings and Credit Association (ROSCA). Beneficiaries form a
group of 12 persons from 3 wards of a Union (thus 3 associations from each Union). Each member
must deposit BDT 300 and the lottery winner gets BDT 3,600. Each member has received the winning
money from ROSCA 3-4 times during the project duration which helped them to invest in small
income-generating activities. The end-line evaluation report revealed that almost 98.21% of the
beneficiaries are involved in IGA activities when only 36% of the control households have earnings
from any such IGAs. SWAPNO women beneficiaries have average of 3-4 types of incomegenerating activities that contribute to household income, savings, and expenditure.
Result 2: SWAPNO beneficiaries’ households have food security and Dietary Diversity
The results of the SWAPNO project are not just noticeable in terms of major economic indicators
but also reflected in dietary diversity and “subjective measures” of well-being. Among the
beneficiary households, 53% have median or above dietary diversity, which is around 31% for the

control households indicating significantly higher dietary diversity for SWAPNO beneficiary
households. Around 20% of the beneficiary households reported food surplus, while only 4.82% of
the control households mentioned that they had surplus food in their houses. They also tend to be
more ambitious, marked with higher aspirations for themselves (20.22% as against 6.03%) and their
children (45.70% vs. 31.87%). The end-line evaluation report stated that the prevalence of
underweight children is comparatively lower in the SWAPNO beneficiary group (2.23% against
5.15%) than in the children from control households. The same trend emerges in the case of stunted
children (3.57% vs. 7.38%).

SWAPNO’s unique initiatives facilitate its beneficiaries to ensure their physical and mental wellbeing. The project conducted life skills training for all beneficiaries. As a result, women learned
about malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies and were encouraged to maintain health hygiene,
proper food intake considering nutritional value in daily life. The beneficiaries also participated in
nutrition campaigns, cooking demonstrations, and courtyard sessions which enhanced their
knowledge and practices on diversified and nutrition food intake in their households. Regular followup by the Union Workers motivated beneficiaries to practice their learning in daily life.
Result 3: SWAPNO beneficiaries have access to Services
The BIDS endline evaluation report revealed that SWAPNO beneficiaries accessed Government and
non-government social and financial services higher than the control group. SWAPNO beneficiaries’
knowledge and information about Government and non-government services increased due to the
project interventions. The women are now aware of their entitlements and are empowered to access
the services.
The evaluation report stated a comparative analysis of five major categories2 of social services
attainment by beneficiaries and control households. The evaluation revealed that the beneficiaries’
knowledge of IT-related services (Computer, e-payment, bKash/Rocket/Nagad, etc.) increased by
nearly double compared
to the control households
(95% vs. 54%). A similar
trend was found in the
other
services
Agriculture (42% vs.
2%), Livestock (40% vs.
4%), and health services
(62% vs. 44%).
The project facilitated its
beneficiaries in getting
access to digital mobile
banking.
Currently,

2

Major category of services includes i) Agriculture, ii) Livestock, iii) Fisheries, iv) health care & v) Information
Technology related services (Computer, e-payment, bKash, Rocket, Nagad etc.)

100% beneficiaries have digital mobile wallets which is higher compared to the control group.
The project performed cash3 transfer activities through bKash/Nagad and beneficiaries received the
amount in their mobile wallets. This can be considered as a spillover effect as even after the
completion of this project, it is still there, and they will continue to conduct monetary transactions
through these digital financing services.
All these results showed that the program had played a significant role in attaining various social
services, including health and digital financial services. Life skills training, awareness development
activities, distribution of mobile phones with SIM cards, linkage with financial institutions,
continuous monitoring, and follow-up support contributed to achieving the results.
Result 4: Women Beneficiaries are better in Mobility and Decision-making
The project has a core mandate to ensure gender equality and women empowerment. Gender issues
have been effectively mainstreamed across all programmatic approaches. The SWAPNO
beneficiaries are no longer viewed as socially excluded women but as participants in a government
program. Also, it contributed to ensuring gender equality by empowering the women beneficiary
groups at personal, family, and community levels through market-led economic activities. Analysis
of mobility and empowerment indicators revealed that the mobility of SWAPNO women at the
Union, Upazila, District, and Division level and decision-making power in the household had
increased significantly. The BIDS evaluation reports of all three cycles revealed that more than 90%
of beneficiaries are decision makers, participate in social institutions, are sole bread earners, and have
full control over household assets and income.
SWAPNO conducted a series of capacity development training for women, linked them with
different service-providing organizations, and enhanced leadership quality to establish women-led
cooperatives and management. All these interventions contributed to raising the beneficiaries’ voices
regarding decision-making and heightened their confidence in communicating with serviceproviding organizations.
Result 5: Resilient livelihoods of SWAPNO beneficiaries against shocks and crises
Women's economic and social empowerment through the SWAPNO model enables them to be better
prepared to cope with shocks and crises like flood/flash floods, cyclones, and COVID-19 pandemic.
Due
to
project
interventions, SWAPNO
beneficiaries faced fewer
crises and effectively
managed the crises and
shocks compared to the
control
households.
According to BIDS
evaluation report, during
the pandemic, the nonbeneficiaries
faced
financial and food-related
crises almost three times
higher
than
their
counterparts. Besides, the
beneficiary households reported facing fewer challenges while buying hygiene kits and food during
COVID-19 pandemic. Almost all the households (93%) in the control groups were worried about
their food consumption as they did not have enough food during the pandemic. Over 66% of the

3

SWAPNO project made digital transaction of all kinds of cash i.e beneficiaries wages, COVID-19 grants allowances
and other government support through beneficiaries mobile accounts using bKash/Nagad.

beneficiary households were well equipped during the COVID pandemic in 2020 to handle food and
financial crises, while it was only 12% in non-beneficiary households.
The above results correlate with the project interventions like climate resilient vegetable cultivation
using SAC method, homestead raising, etc. to cope with flood/flash floods. Moreover, the project’s
mass awareness on COVID-19, hygiene kits (1,91,044 no.), food support (14,880 packets) to
households, and cash transfer to beneficiaries enabled the beneficiaries to handle the COVID-19
crisis more than the control groups.
3. PROGRESS REVIEW
The project has achieved significant progress against the set of indicators of each outcome in the
ProDoc (referred RRF in Annex 1). The beneficiaries received various training from the beginning
of the project intervention; now they are more vocal when approaching UP and local service
providers. 100% of the beneficiaries have taken life skills and livelihood skills development training
which helped them to enhance their capacity to engage in different income-generating activities.
Household income of the beneficiaries has increased over time, almost six-times higher compared to
the base situation. The beneficiary households’ expenditure and savings increased through the project
intervention. Presently, the beneficiary household’s monthly average expenditure is almost three
times higher (BDT 9,827 or USD 115.6) compare to the base situation of (BDT 2,901 or USD 34).
The productive asset value of beneficiary households increased dramatically compared to the control
group. The current average productive asset value of the beneficiary household is BDT 35,344 (USD
416) and the control group is BDT 10,485 (USD 123). The benefits from the SWAPNO project are
not just noticeable in terms of major economic indicators but also reflected in terms of dietary
diversity and "subjective measures" of well-being. Among the beneficiary households, 53% percent
have a median or above bear dietary diversity, which is around 31% for the control households
indicating significantly higher dietary diversity for SWAPNO beneficiary households. Around 20%
of the beneficiary households reported food surplus while only 4.82% of the control households
mentioned that they had surplus food in their house. An increase in income/earnings, expenditure,
savings, and assets accumulation of SWAPNO beneficiaries gives them self-confidence and selfesteem. More than 90% of SWAPNO beneficiaries are decision-makers, participate in social
institutions, are sole bread earners, and they have complete control over their assets and income
(Source: BIDS Endline Evaluation 2022).
3.1
OUTPUT 1: CORE BENEFICIARIES ARE ABLE TO PROTECT THEIR FOOD
SECURITY AND LIVELIHOODS POST-PROJECT.
Output 1 focuses on SWAPNO’s public works-based poverty graduation approach. The emphasis is
on “women’s employability”. Women are engaged with wage employment through public works
with training on market-based skills and productive employment and supported to move out of
poverty at the end of the project cycle.
Contributing to this output, significant results have been achieved through the project intervention.
The average monthly income, expenditure, savings, and productive assets of the beneficiary
households increased over time; the BIDS endline evaluation report 2022 revealed that 98% women
beneficiaries are presently self-employed, and the average monthly income of the beneficiary
household increased by 443% compared with the base situation (refer Annex 1 for details). The BIDS
final evaluation report also revealed that the value of current productive assets4 of beneficiary
households is BDT 160,299 (USD 1,908) which is 58% higher than that of the control group of BDT
101,907 (USD 1,213).
Below are the accomplishments under the output 1:

Here productive assets are considered the existing households’ cattle, poultry, sewing machine those have ability to
contributing household income.

3.1.1 Selection of extreme poor women as core beneficiaries: At the beginning of SWAPNO
intervention, the project assisted the UPs and communities to select 12,492 women beneficiaries of
223 Unions under five districts5 – who are widowed, abandoned, divorced, separated or have a
husband with disability who is unable to earn and maintain the family. The beneficiaries were
selected through mass
awareness
and
publicity,
final
selection through the
open lottery, individual
house
visits
and
validation. The Union
Parishad
led
the
selection process in
close collaboration with
the Partner NGOs along
with
community
representatives
and
leaders. The UPs have
signed a contract with
women groups where
beneficiary rights and
entitlements, payment
mechanism,
and
beneficiary
responsibilities are clearly mentioned. The project enlisted those selected women in the project MIS
database and considered as core beneficiaries.
3.1.2 Public Asset Maintenance and Employment of extreme poor women: SWAPNO enabled
the community to select need-based and climate adaptive public assets through ward sabha meetings
in the inception period of project intervention. A total of 12,492 rural extreme poor women have
completed their employment tenure by April 2021, and 100% of beneficiaries got their wage payment
through their mobile wallets. SWAPNO project helped not only the beneficiaries but also others in
the community indirectly through the local-level public works program. Through the Community
Risk Assessment/ Rapid Risk Assessment Process (CRA/RRAP), 14,567 public assets were
prioritized. Among these public assets, 3876 were maintained for disaster risk reduction. Disaster
Risk Reduction related schemes include embankment repair, canal re-excavation, tree plantation, and
field raising to protect from flooding and water logging. As a result, community people in 223 Unions
have benefited from rural infrastructure development activities. The public asset model applied in
SWAPNO achieved efficiency through directly supporting the livelihoods of participating
households and creating pro-poor public goods (assets) that profited the larger community and
contributed to inclusive economic growth.

3.1.3 Promoted savings habits for securing livelihoods: One of the notable interventions of the
SWAPNO project is to inculcate the savings habit among the beneficiaries through the Rotating
Savings and Credit Association (ROSCA). The advantage of ROSCA is that it offers a “commitment
device”: the pressure to put money aside regularly helps them to save, which might have been
difficult for many of them given
the lack of self-control in the face
of many competing spending
demands. By the end of
employment tenure, the total
ROSCA savings of 12,492
beneficiaries stood at BDT 16
crore (USD 1.7 million). Each
beneficiary has generated BDT
12,808 (USD 150) on average,
which they have invested in
several income-earning activities
like small business, livestock
rearing, etc. So, ROSCAs have
provided them easy access to lump sums that can be directly invested for productive purposes.
3.1.4

Promoted sustainable livelihood: SWAPNO has provided demand-driven livelihood skills
training to the project beneficiaries. Based on
Market Opportunity Survey (MOS) and
Training Needs Assessment (TNA), the project
had identified four major areas for developing
decent livelihoods: poultry and duck farming,
cow rearing and beef fattening, goat and sheep
farming, and small business management.
Beneficiaries received 4 days of modular
training based on their choice. Moreover, all
beneficiaries received 2 days of mandatory
kitchen garden training to harvest or manage at
least one nutrition item from their household.

After completing the demand-driven livelihood skills training of beneficiaries, they are engaged in
different Income Generating Activities (IGAs) like cow rearing, goat rearing, poultry rearing,
tailoring, vegetable cultivation, small trades, etc. The project’s endline evaluation revealed that 98%
beneficiaries have two to three types of IGAs, on average, whereas it is only 36% for the control
households. All these indicate that SWAPNO has a positive effect on the beneficiaries, which
enabled them to be involved in additional income-generating activities.
3.1.5 Women are promoted for formal sector employment: The project has developed cost-sharing
partnerships with export-oriented green factories such as Ecofab Ltd, Green Smart Shirt Ltd, and
skills-providing organizations like the Center of Excellence for Leather Skills (COEL) to transfer
industrial skills and placement in jobs after assessing their learning. SWAPNO’s strong partnership
with these factories helped to enhance the capacity of beneficiaries as per the requirements of
industries through skill development training. As a result of these initiatives, job placement was done
for 588 women in several RMG and Leather factories. After job placement, SWAPNO conducts postjob counseling sessions to learn about the beneficiaries' working experiences and guides them to
make necessary adjustments to the workplace environment.

3.2 OUTPUT 2: CORE BENEFICIARIES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS HAVE IMPROVED
THEIR HUMAN CAPITAL IN TERMS OF NUTRITION, HEALTH, EDUCATION AND
VOICE
Output 2 focuses on enhancing conditions that promote women empowerment. It removes existing
barriers so that women can act on their decision to graduate out of poverty. Especially, by working
with the Government, UN, and NGO partners.
The project has transformed the lives of rural women by providing life skills training on health and
nutrition, financial literacy, gender development, disaster risk reduction, etc. This has helped them
uplift their confidence, courage, moral strength, and bargaining power with local service providers.
Since the bargaining power has increased, beneficiaries have been able to talk with Union Parishad
(UP) and other local service providers.
Below are the accomplishments under the output 2:
3.2.1 Life skills training to beneficiaries on seven key issues: As part of the skill development
initiatives, the project conducted life skills training to the beneficiaries on seven different
development subjects represented in the graph below:

Accordingly, training modules were developed for all mentioned subjects with contents and duration
specified for each subject. SWAPNO hired a training organization to facilitate conducting the
training. While conducting sessions, union workers applied some ice-breaking exercises to make
participants active and lively. These exercises made the sessions more enjoyable for the participants.
Participants got the scope to express their
feelings and ask questions to clarify the issues
not clear to them.
3.2.2 Nutrition awareness campaign: Due
to a lack of awareness regarding the food
nutrients, rural women process and cook foods
wrongly, making them the victims of nutrition
deficiency. In this regard, SWAPNO has
conducted courtyard sessions, cooking

demonstrations, and nutrition campaigns in 223 Unions. A total of 12,492 women beneficiaries were
reached through these awareness development events. As a result of these awareness development
activities, community people raised awareness on nutrition issues and introduced and practiced
dietary diversity in their food habits. The BIDS endline evaluation report revealed that 53% of
beneficiary households bear median or above dietary diversity, nearly two times higher than the
control households (31.2%). This indicates a positive correlation between the beneficiary
household’s increased income and awareness development on nutrition issues.
3.2.3 Mobility and decision making: SWAPNO beneficiaries have been able to lift themselves up
economically and have also empowered themselves socially, with women reporting higher
aspirations for themselves and their children. Their decision-making power has also increased in
terms of initiating new Income Generating Activities (IGAs), selling of household products and raise
participating in meetings.
3.2.4 COVID-19 awareness development and support to people: Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the
project took the initiative to raise awareness of the beneficiary households to avoid transmission by
following WHO advisories. The project disseminated awareness-raising messages through
loudspeakers, conducted hand-washing demonstration sessions, and distributed soap bars and facial
masks among the beneficiaries. As most beneficiaries incurred income loss during the two-monthlockdown in 2020, the project appealed to UNDP for a solidarity package and cash grants. UNDP
approached the private sector for contribution, and eventually, the United Group of Bangladesh and
the Citi group-Bangkok joined hands with UNDP. Apart from this, SWAPNO received cash grants
of BDT 1500 for each of the beneficiaries, which were transferred through mobile wallets.

3.3 OUTPUT 3: CORE BENEFICIARY HOUSEHOLDS HAVE ACCESS TO PUBLIC
SERVICES ESSENTIAL FOR THEIR LIVELIHOOD ACTIVITIES AND FAMILY WELLBEING.
SWAPNO beneficiaries’ access to Government and non-government social services has increased
significantly than the control households. The beneficiary women now become aware of their
entitlements and are empowered to access them. The BIDS endline evaluation report 2022 revealed
that beneficiary households seek more support from Upazila agriculture and livestock offices than
the control households. A similar trend was also found at union level services; 95% of beneficiary
households seek support from union parishad (i.e computer, e-payment, bKash/Rocket/ etc.), which
is almost double compared to the control households (54%). For the first time, 1,587 SWAPNO
women beneficiaries have access to micro-health insurance through the project intervention.
Moreover, with the support from Zilla and Upazila administration, 101 beneficiaries have received
climate-resilient housing of Government-owned Ashrayan project. 100% of beneficiaries have access
to digital financial services using their mobile wallets.
The benefits from the SWAPNO project are also reflected in dietary diversity and “subjective
measures” of well-being. Among the beneficiary households, 53% percent have median or above
bear dietary diversity, whereas around 31% of the control households indicate significantly higher
dietary diversity for SWAPNO beneficiary households. Around 20% of the beneficiary households
reported food surplus, while only 4.82% of the control households mentioned that they had surplus
food in their house.
Below are the accomplishments under the output 3:
3.3.1 Access to Services: The project beneficiaries have enhanced coordination with UPs and
service delivery departments, which have positively impacted the core beneficiaries' livelihoods. The
project endline evaluation report revealed that SWAPNO beneficiary households accessed different
services6 more frequently than the non-beneficiary households in their communities.
3.3.2 Provision of micro-insurance for beneficiaries: This initiative was undertaken in the year
2021 in association with Green Delta Insurance and
Micro-Fintech on a pilot basis. The insurance has
covered 1,587 women beneficiaries of 5 Upazilas of
Jamalpur district. Two insurance policies have been
developed - SWAPNO Suraksha Policy and SWAPNO
Shathi Policy. These policies have provided the
beneficiaries with the financial support incurred for
hospitalization or in-house treatment. When
beneficiaries get sick, they initially go to the doctor and
buy medicines from the local medical store as per the
doctor’s advice. Afterward, the beneficiaries share all
supportive documents with the insurance company
through the SWAPNO office. Finally, they receive the
final amount in their mobile wallets through bKash. To date, 32 beneficiaries have received their
claimed amount of BDT 71,414 (USD 840).
3.3.3 Access to digital financial services: Women’s knowledge and information about digital
financial services is increased due to the project intervention. The capacity development training on
digital financial transaction increased the knowledge of beneficiaries. Presently 100% of
beneficiaries have mobile accounts.

6

Major services included the technical suggestion from GoB line departments, services from UPs, health
services from upazila, district and divisional level etc.

3.4 OUTPUT 4: PUBLIC ASSETS PROMOTING ECONOMIC GROWTH, IMPROVING
SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND ENHANCING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ARE
MAINTAINED AND DEVELOPED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE POOR OF THE
PARTICIPATING RURAL COMMUNITIES.
Under this outcome, SWAPNO has completed public assets maintenance work central to the local
communities' economic and social life. Toal 12,492 women were selected as core beneficiaries of the
project and employed in Women Crew Groups (WCGs) for public works. The project maintained
and repaired 14,567 schemes in 223 unions, in which 48,78,910 people in rural areas benefited from
access to nearby markets, education and health institutions, and Union parishad. The project
beneficiaries have worked around 5,347,856 days, increasing income, savings, and productive assets.
By maintaining public assets, SWAPNO project has protected its beneficiaries from poverty,
developed their skills for more constructive engagement in income-earning activities, and provided
a broader set of inputs required for a more profound developmental impact.
Below are the accomplishments under the output 4:
3.4.1 Public Works maintenance Programme: SWAPNO’s graduation approach stands on this
cash-for-work policy and other supportive interventions like forced savings, digital payment,
training, etc., that facilitate
employment creation of
ultra-poor rural women
through developing and
maintaining
local
infrastructure. SWAPNO
enabled the community to
select 14,567 need-based
public assets through ward
sabha meetings. 63% (9,200
no.) of the public assets are
earthen road maintenance,
24% (3,484 no.) are field
raising of educational and
religious institutions, 10%
(1,491 no.) are repairing
slopes of herringbone roads,
and
3%
(392
no.)
encompasses embankment
maintenance, canal reaper,
and tree plantation.
3.4.2 Wage
Payments:
The project created employment for 12,492 women beneficiaries, a total of 5,347,856 person days
were created, and beneficiaries got wages through a digital financial transaction in their mobile
wallets. The BIDS evaluation report revealed that the employment of women beneficiaries increased
household income, savings, and asset accumulation that contributed to their livelihood development.
3.5 OUTPUT 5: LOCAL COMMUNITIES HAVE A BETTER CAPACITY TO WITHSTAND
NATURAL DISASTERS AND RECOVER AFTER DISASTERS
This output aims to address the challenges and vulnerabilities of climate change and reduce risks
associated with natural disaster. The project addressed the issue by providing disaster adaptive soft
skills training, Union Disaster Management Committee (UDMC) members training and
implementing different adaptive livelihood activities like tree plantation, sack cultivation,
vermicompost production, low-cost Hydroponic technology for fodder production, distribution of

agro-inputs like seeds, saplings of fruit trees, and fertilizer. Using Sack cultivation method, almost
100% of beneficiaries have engaged with sack cultivation in their homestead. They can now fulfill
their family needs and earn additional income by selling the produced vegetables and crops in the
local market. The project provided training and setup support for establishing Hydroponic technology
to produce fodder/grass. By applying low-cost Hydroponic technology, beneficiaries can afford
enough fodder during the flood for their cattle. The project developed the capacity of the beneficiaries
to produce vermicompost using eco-friendly technologies. All these adaptive approaches facilitated
the beneficiaries to combat shocks induced by natural disasters.
Below are the accomplishments under the output 5:
3.5.1 Climate resilient cultivation: SWAPNO beneficiaries have cultivated climate-resilient
vegetables in 23,145 sacks (an average of 6 sacks each household). Most of the beneficiaries
consumed vegetables in their production, and many of them sold vegetables in the local markets and
buying and selling points. The major types of produced vegetables are cucumber, pumpkin, basil
leaf, coriander, bean, etc. The field monitoring and follow-up visits revealed that most of the
beneficiaries successfully applied the sack cultivation method in their homesteads.
3.5.2 Environment-friendly fertilizer production: Vermicompost is the product of the
decomposition process using various species
of worms, usually red wigglers, white worms,
and other earthworms, to create a mixture of
decomposing vegetable or food waste, bedding
materials, and vermicast. The project has
selected beneficiaries who have cattle farms and
trained them on vermicompost production. The
project intervention enhanced the capacity of
100 beneficiaries who have been producing
vermicompost. On average, the market value of
the compost fertilizer for each beneficiary is
BDT 3000 to 4000 taka.
3.5.3 Homestead raising of vulnerable households: The development of climate-resilient
homesteads, particularly raising plinths of homesteads in low-lying char areas, is a significant
intervention of SWAPNO. In close consultation with the local communities and UPs, a total of 198
beneficiaries are selected from Jamalpur, Gaibandha, and Lalmonirhat districts to provide partial
support to raising their homestead. The selected beneficiaries worked in a group and completed the
task in rotation. The raised plinth is protected those houses from inundation by the flood. It also
allows household members to opt for year-round vegetable cultivation and rearing of livestock and
poultry on the homestead.
3.5.4 Established low-cost hydroponic technology: The Char and flood-prone areas' beneficiaries
face difficulties collecting fodder – particularly in August-November. During the crisis period, the
price of fodder gets high and rises to BDT 20 per kg. To help these beneficiaries with climate-resilient
and low-cost fodder production, the project introduced low-cost Hydroponic technology. A total of
40 beneficiaries installed hydroponic sets with locally available materials like bamboo, plastic tray,
PVC pipe, etc., and produced fodder. After producing fodder, beneficiaries feed their cattle and have
noticed significant changes. Their cows are getting healthier. They are now growing 30-40 kg of
fodder in a month and minimizing the fodder crisis during the crisis.
3.5.5 Enterprise development & Local employment creation: The project developed women’s
skills to become self-employed, the project helped train and place women in jobs in local Small and
Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Below are the major enterprise run by women:

•

Low-cost Sanitary Napkins for women and adolescent girls: In the year 2020, SWAPNO
beneficiaries from Kurigram came forward with an idea to produce low-cost sanitary napkins
for rural women and adolescent girls, forming a Cooperative named ‘Kallayani Nari Kallayan
Samittee’. The cooperative has trained and recruited 5 beneficiaries in each Union of
Kurigram who are working as sales agents. They took the lead in producing low-cost sanitary
pads to offer affordable health hygiene solutions for poor women and girls and create
employment across the production and supply chain. The project conducted awareness
sessions through courtyard meetings with women and adolescent girls on Menstrual Hygiene
and sanitary napkins. This cooperative produces sanitary napkins and sells them to local
women and girls at an affordable price.

• Shunipun

mini-garments: In 2020,
SWAPNO established ‘Shunipun Minigarments’ in Kaliganj Upazila, Satkhira, in
association with UNCDF and officially
started operations in January 2021. 25
employees, including SWAPNO women,
are working in this garment; each
beneficiary gets BDT 6000 monthly.
Alongside promoting decent working
opportunities, Shunipun is contributing to
market-based
skills
development,
enhancing income, and aiding the scalingup of businesses in Satkhira and adjacent
districts.

•

Development of milk chilling plant in Kurigram: As part of SWAPNO’s “Promoting Gender
Responsive Enterprise Through Dairy Value Chain Activities”, the project established
partnerships with UNCDF and Eco-Social Development Foundation (ESDF) to establish a
milk chilling plant in Kurigram District. With the support of UNCDF and Eco-Social
Development Foundation (ESDF), the beneficiaries of the cooperatives have purchased 8
decimals of land. House construction has been completed, and the milk chilling plant is in the
process of being established. It is expected that 500 SWAPNO beneficiaries and nearby
community people involved in cow rearing will benefit directly from this milk chilling plant.

•

Establishment of Chicken Hatchery: SWAPNO beneficiaries in Jamalpur, Gaibandha, and
Lalmonirhat districts have established 7
chicken hatcheries to produce native
breed chicks. As a result of this
initiative, the beneficiaries collect
native chicks locally, raise three to six
months for eggs production and sell live
chickens in the market. These chicken
hatcheries have fulfilled the demand for
the beneficiaries' chicken. Each owner
of the farm has been earning BDT 8000
– 10000 monthly.

•

Established water treatment plant: Generally, people in Gaibandha privately extract water
from a depth of 35 to 50 feet of ground for drinking purposes. This drinking water is
contaminated by Iron and Arsenic, both of which are hazardous to human health. The
contamination is relatively higher in
Gazaria and Kanchipara Unions of
Gaibandha. In this regard, SWAPNO
mobilized its beneficiaries in Gaibandha
to form a cooperative for establishing a
Water Treatment Plant (WTP) in Gazaria
in collaboration with Fulchari Upazilla
Administration of Gaibandha. Fulchari
Upazilla Administration allocated two
spots in the two unions (Kanchipara and
Gazaria) to establish the WTP. Finally,
the WTP is established with the capacity
of 8,000-liter water per day. The cooperative operates the WTP, distributes water to the
community people, and sells surplus production as bottled water to the local market. Around
300 households and about 100 commercial entities buy this water with a minimum charge
from the cooperative.

•

Women-led group farming: One of the innovative features of SWAPNO project is to
capitalize on the group approach in all aspects of the poverty graduation journey. SWAPNO
introduced the Group farming concept by mobilizing women groups and well-off people of
the community simultaneously and establishing a commercial relationship to transform the
landless women into commercial farmers. About 120 women under 15 groups started group
farming in Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, and Jamalpur districts.

•

Women-led buying-selling points: The women-led 171 buying and selling points have been
established and operating successfully by the women beneficiaries. These buying and selling
points have created a win-win situation for the buyers and sellers of local communities.
Sellers can easily sell their products at these points, and buyers can avail of the products from
these shops. Generally, the villagers buy vegetable seeds, fertilizers, seasonal vegetables, and
other agricultural products from these points. On average, BDT 8000 to 10,000 are sold
monthly by each buying and selling owner.

3.6 OUTPUT 6: LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS THE CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT
SOCIAL TRANSFER PROJECTS WITH ACCOUNTABILITY, TRANSPARENCY,
GENDER SENSITIVITY, AND A PRO-POOR APPROACH.
The project has consciously invested in “Ownership Building” with the Local Government Division,
District and Upazila Administration and the Union Parishad (UP) in various ways. These include
extensive reporting, briefing, and meetings, accounts operation, and day-to-day project operation
management. The Central account is operated jointly by the National Project Director (NPD) and
the National Project Manager (NPM), the district account is jointly used by the Deputy Director of
Local Government (DDLG) and District Manager (DM), while three signatories operate the UP
Account: the UP Chair, Chairperson of the concerned Standing Committee-a female member of UP
and the Secretary. The project developed the capacity of 223 UPs representatives through various
training and coordination meetings; as a result, the UPs are more responsive to supporting community
people.
Below are the accomplishments under the output 6:
3.6.1 Capacity Development of UPs/UDMCs: Union Disaster Management Committees (UDMCs)
are supposed to play a vital role in reducing disaster risks at the local level. It was observed that the
UDMC members do not have adequate knowledge of disaster risk reduction & climate change

adaptation
strategies
and
limited
understanding of roles and responsibilities as
per the Standing Order on Disasters (SOD).
Strengthening the local institutional capacity is
one of the core outcomes of the SWAPNO
project to reduce the vulnerability of distressed
women and available services for the
community. SWAPNO trained 5,472 Union
Disaster Management Committee (UDMC)
members from 171 Unions on Genderresponsive Disaster Risk Reduction and
Climate Change Adaptation strategies. It
provided an understanding of gender roles that need to be included in all aspects of disaster risk
reduction activities. The members can now support local communities to adapt resilient technology
and coordinate with development partners and service-providing departments to implement the action
plan for risk reduction.
3.6.2 UPs/UDMCs Regular Coordination Meeting: SWAPNO provided technical support to
conduct the quarterly meeting of UDMCs. UDMC meetings were held at 171 UPs of Jamalpur,
Gaibandha, Lalmonirhat, and Kurigram districts during this reporting period. Following agendas
were discussed:
• Roles and responsibilities of the UDMC as per SOD.
• Flood situation.
• Disaster preparedness in the local context.
• Awareness on climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction.
3.6.3 Strictly adheres to its Internal Control framework for Corruption-free implementation:
SWAPNO adopted Internal Control Framework (ICF) for effective, efficient, and transparent project
fund disbursement and expenditures. SWAPNO’s ICF has been developed in line with UNDP’s
corporate Internal Control Framework (ICF) for preventing misappropriation and pilferage and the
National Implementation Modality (NIM) modalities (i.e. Government of Bangladesh’s rules and
procedures) of 2017. The mechanisms of ICF have also been incorporated into SWAPNO’s
Operational Manual.
3.6.4 Ownership development of Local Government Division: The project has made strategic
investments in "Ownership Building" with the Union Parishad (UP), the District and Upazila
Administration, and the Local Government Division. These include in-depth reporting, briefings, and
meetings; the project also involves them in decision-making, account management, and day-to-day
project operation management. Three signatories operate the UP Account: the UP Chair, the
Chairperson of the concerned Standing Committee—a female member of UP—and the Secretary.
The National Project Director (NPD) and the National Project Manager (NPM) jointly operate the
Central account. The Deputy Director of Local Government (DDLG) and the District Manager (DM)
jointly use the District account.
3.6.5 Ownership Building of Community People: Community involvement is embedded in the
project through the contribution of road maintenance materials such as soil gathered from
homesteads, protection and monitoring of SWAPNO women at work in public places, and
supervision of the beneficiary selection process. This involvement builds community ownership and
helps establish reciprocal accountability and a participatory monitoring process.
3.6.6 Assessment and Evaluation Conduction: SWAPNO conducted evidence-based surveys,
studies and evaluations. The project conducted baseline and endline evaluation through third-party
engagement. The baseline report has supported setting the base status, endline evaluation has
supported forming results of the set of indicators as per Result Resource Indicators (IRRF).

3.7
Gender and Youth
SWAPNO has a core mandate to ensure gender equality and women empowerment. All
programmatic approaches have effectively mainstreamed gender concerns. By enabling the project's
female beneficiary groups to make their own decisions at the individual, family, and community
levels through market-driven economic activities, the intervention has strengthened gender equality.
SWAPNO promotes women's self-esteem, agility, and empowerment. More than 90% of
beneficiaries are fully in charge of their assets and income, take part in social institutions, and are the
only ones who earn a living. The project emphasizes empowering women as a strategy for
contributing to a positive transformation of their position in both public and private spheres. The
project has been designed to contribute significantly towards i) increasing women’s access to income
ii) control over assets iii) access to information and knowledge iv) mobility in the public sphere v)
capacity for decision making vi) participation in community activities and vii) decreasing different
forms of violence and discrimination based on the women’s identities of gender and economic status
and harassment. The project is categorized as – GEN 3 by UNDP.
3.8
LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND
The project has selected 100% excluded rural women who are widowed (47%), abandoned (27%),
divorced (18%), separated, or have a husband with a disability (8%). Using a rigorous beneficiary
selection process, the project actively engaged community members, local journalists, NGO, and
Upazila level government officials to supervise the entire process. Finally, Union Parishad approved
the list of the beneficiaries for employment. 96% of SWAPNO's women are successfully targeted as
a result of transparency and active participation from all stakeholders.
3.9
Social and Environmental Considerations
The project piloted environment-friendly initiatives and techniques on a limited scale before wider
implementation. For example, the project first steered the Hydroponic technology in Kurigram
district, and after getting better results, the project replicated this technology in other districts.
Similarly, the project beneficiaries introduced vegetable cultivation using the Sac method, which is
fully environment-friendly. Presently, each beneficiary households have average of 5-6 Sacks in their
homestead where they produce vegetables to fulfill household demands and sell the remaining
portion to the local markets.
4. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
4.1
Accountability
The project has been carefully designed to incorporate all stakeholders to ensure reciprocal
accountability. These include beneficiary and public assets selection through community level
meeting, developed comprehensive operation manual to specify stakeholders' roles and
responsibilities and strictly adhering to the Internal Control Framework (ICF). Moreover, the project
published a beneficiary directory which includes geographical location, name and mobile telephone
numbers to enable the Government, UNDP and Donors to go for remote monitoring. The hotline
numbers ensure grievance redressal. Finally, a 100% digital payment mechanism to transfer wages
and other financial benefits has made the project corruption free.
4.2
Quality of Partnerships with Stakeholders
The project established partnerships with the Government, Private sector, and UN organizations that
have improved the project’s model and contributed to economic, social and environmental
sustainability. The project successfully implemented its activities with support from Marico Limited,
Embassy of Sweden, BSRM Ltd., Fakir Apparels, Ecofab Ltd, Green Smart Shirt (GSS) Ltd, Leather
and Footwear Manufacturing and Exporter Association of Bangladesh (LFMEAB).
In association with United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), the project has established
‘Shunipun Mini-garments’ in Satkhira, where the project beneficiaries maintained a significant level

of ownership. UNCDF and Eco-Social Development Foundation (ESDF) supported the project of
establishing a milk chilling plant.
For SWAPNO, NGOs played a crucial role in supporting UPs to implement the project following
GoB and UNDP guidelines. NGOs were involved in selecting eligible project beneficiaries, training
them and facilitating implementation process.
4.3
Technical Capacity
SWAPNO developed the technical capacity of implementing partners on financial management,
monitoring and reporting, and the Management Information System (MIS) maintenance. The project
developed the capacity of 12,492 women beneficiaries to implement and manage their incomegenerating activities in their locality. A total of 588 women got employment after completing their
skill development training through the project intervention.
4.4
Communication and Advocacy
SWAPNO project is implemented jointly by the Local Government Division and UNDP in five
poverty and disaster-prone districts. As mentioned earlier, the project has employed rural women in
Local Government’s Public Works Program. Because of the entrenched societal norms, women are
generally left behind in participating in this program. The project has carefully addressed this
problem by drafting an advocacy strategy that has enabled SWAPNO women to be their own
advocates under the umbrella of their local level elected representatives.
In terms of communication, the project developed a communication plan addressing the relevant
stakeholders aiming to disseminate the project’s results and achievements. The project has developed
several communication materials like Brochures, Leaflets, Posters, Video documentaries, Booklets,
Reports, TV talk shows, etc which portrayed the achievements of SWAPNO in terms of poverty
graduation, gender equality, disaster risk reduction, health & nutrition, formal sector employment,
etc. and widely circulated to the mass people, donors, partners and other stakeholders.
5. MANAGEMENT EFFECTIVENESS
5.1
Project Design
SWAPNO is a public-works and social transfer-based poverty graduation project that targets ultrapoor rural women who are widowed, divorced, abandoned, or left with a disabled husband. The
project does not only aim at lifting poor women out of poverty during the project period; it also helps
them sustain a higher income level after the end of project support. To achieve this goal, the focus is
on future employability. The idea is that the set of skills learned from training will help women invest
their savings for productive purposes, which would yield a stream of income in years to come. In
addition to self-employment, SWAPNO helps place women in jobs in local Small and Medium
Enterprises (SMEs) and private sector companies in the formal and informal sectors.
While SWAPNO has demonstrated success, lessons show that women risk falling back into poverty
as they are malnutrition, vulnerable to climate and disaster risks, and can risk facing gender-based
violence by participating in a project that can be perceived as challenging social norms. At the same
time, the project has successfully piloted public-private partnerships that improve the women’s skills
and help place them in formal sector jobs; it also ran successful micro pilots that used mobile money
for promoting financial inclusion and improving efficiency in the government-to-person (G2P)
platform. The findings on mobile money will inform national policy on scaling up digital payments
through G2P across Bangladesh.
By integrating these lessons, this proposal outlines SWAPNO strategy to support women’s access to
decent employment, ensure a discrimination-free environment in public workplaces, develop
adaptive livelihoods and access to financial services for sustainable graduation from extreme poverty,
and develop local government capacity to implement pro-poor projects.

5.2
Oversight
SWAPNO adheres to a systematic bookkeeping and reporting system to prevent financial
irregularities, particularly for crew wage disbursement and block grants. Responsible officers (from
field to headquarters levels) monitor financial transactions regularly at different tiers. UNDP auditors
(both internal and external) spot-check randomly selected UPs during the annual UNDP-Bangladesh
audit. When risks or irregularities are identified, concerned authorities are immediately notified to
take corrective measures to ensure the integrity of the financial system.
For taking stock of accounting practices in the field, staff members from UNDP Country Office and
authorized project staff such as National Project Manager (NPM), Finance and Administrative
Officer, Subject Matter Specialists, and responsible deputed government officers from Project
Management Unit (PMU), carry out spot checks of project accounts in randomly selected Union
Parishads (UPs). Whenever they come across any irregularities, they take corrective measures on the
spot, involving Deputy Commissioner/Upazilla Nirbahi Officer/Bank Manager as required.
SWAPNO has established a reciprocal grievance redressal system. The project circulated a Hotline
number among SWAPNO women, UP representatives and Standing Committee (SC) members.
Women use this hotline to report on any financial anomalies or challenges that they face. The
complaints are dealt with immediate action. A telephone directory of all beneficiaries is made
available to all stakeholders to carry out random checks on deliveries.
5.3
Monitoring and Evaluation
SWAPNO has a comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation and Management Information System
(M&E and MIS) to track the activity progress and evaluate the progress and achievement of intended
results. A central online M&E and MIS incorporating the key performance indicators is functional
for the project. The information gathered from different tiers of the project operation from UP to
District levels is fed into the system regularly so that the project management at different levels can
make operational decisions based on the latest field information. The District Manager, responsible
at the district level, is supported by the Project Coordinator and Project Officers of partner NGOs to
maintain and feed all the relevant data into the central MIS for continuous flow of information to all
concerned. The Dhaka office of SWAPNO project manages the MIS system.
The M&E system has two key components: 1) Management Information System (MIS); 2)
Monitoring and Evaluation.
Management Information System (MIS): The MIS is an integral part of project management and
acts as the tool for operational decision-making at the field and central levels. The roles of MIS are
primarily the application of MIS database at the district level and providing necessary information
on project delivery against the Annual Work Plan (AWP). The task of MIS includes data collection,
data processing, data analysis, structured report generation for operational management and
maintenance and refinement of information flow from the field to the headquarter.
Monitoring and Evaluation: The monitoring and evaluation component is based on the principles
of result monitoring (output to outcome) outlined in the Theory of Change of SWAPNO. The
emphasis of monitoring is on assessing whether and how interventions contribute to achieving the
project's intended objectives. The focus of evaluation is on assessing the project's impact achievement
and eventually identifying the project's cost and benefit in the end.
In accordance with the programming policies and procedures outlined in the UNDP User Guide,
the project is monitored through the following:
Within the annual cycle:
▪ Every quarter, a qualitative progress report is prepared based on the key results achieved in each
quarter.

▪
▪
▪
▪
▪

An Issue Log is activated in Atlas and updated to facilitate tracking and resolution of potential
problems or change requests.
Based on the initial risk analysis, a risk log is activated in Atlas and regularly updated by
reviewing the external environment that may affect project implementation.
Based on the above information recorded in Atlas, a Project Progress Report (PPR) is submitted
by the Project Manager to the Project Board through Project Assurance, using the standard report
format available in Executive Snapshot.
A project Lesson-learned log is activated and regularly updated to ensure ongoing learning and
adaptation within the organization and to facilitate the preparation of the Lessons-learned Report
at the end of the project.
A Monitoring Schedule Plan is activated in Atlas and updated to track key management
actions/events.

Annually:
Annual Review Report: An Annual Review Report is prepared by the Project Manager and shared
with the Project Board and the Outcome Board. As a minimum requirement, the Annual Review
Report consists of the Atlas standard format for the QPR, covering the whole year with updated
information for each above element of the QPR as well as a summary of results achieved against predefined annual targets at the output level.
Annual Project Review: Based on the above report, an annual project review is conducted during the
fourth quarter of the year, which assesses the project performance, and appraises the Annual Work
Plan (AWP) for the following year.
Result Oriented Annual Report: Based on the prescribed format, the project prepared the ROAR
report at the end of each year to the UNDP Country Office.
Assessment and Evaluation: The project conducted an evidence-based baseline assessment and
endline evaluation of the project with third-party engagement (refer to the evaluation findings in
section 2)
5.5
Cost-Effectiveness and Timely Delivery
The project has significant cost-effectiveness through the efficiency provided by its design and the
program’s effectiveness in strengthening long-term developmental impact. SWAPNO achieves
efficiency through three channels: (i) directly supporting livelihoods of participating households – a
push out of poverty; (ii) facilitating that marginalized women get access to a range of public services
– a pull out of poverty; and (iii) creating pro-poor public goods (assets) that benefit the larger
community and contribute to inclusive economic growth. This yields multiplier benefits that improve
investment efficiency. The longer-term effectiveness in strengthening development impact provides
a sustainable contribution to cost-effectiveness and real value-for-money. By linking financial
inclusion, human capital development, gender equity, and other comprehensive elements,
SWAPNO’s integrated developmental model strengthens economic and social impacts and generates
sustainable and deepening impacts. It is recognized, however, that cost-benefit calculations for
comprehensive social protection programmes are very difficult, as quantifying the full span of
benefits poses significant challenges.
The BIDS endline evaluation 2022 revealed that 98.21% of the beneficiaries were covered with IGA
training and are now conducting income-generating activities (average 3-4types of IGAs). Increased
household income, savings, expenditure, productive assets, mobility and decision-making power
revealed that the SWAPNO project is on the right track. The project’s inputs and activities were
managed efficiently to achieve the intended results (refer result framework indicators in the annex).

6. IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES & LESSONS LEARNED
6.1
Challenges
The project has faced some challenges, particularly during the COVID pandemic and country-wide
lockdown period (September 2020 to August 2021). However, through the effective partnership of
the Government, UNDP, and donor agencies, SWAPNO addressed the challenges effectively.
6.1.1 Delay in Formal sector training: Formal sector training of the project beneficiaries was
supposed to be held in 2020. Due to the country-wide lockdown of the COVID pandemic and
restrictions on mass gathering, the training started on April 2021 in the RMG sector and May 2021
in the Leather Sector. Despite delays, the project successfully completed the formal sector training
in 2021, following all safety measures.
6.1.2 Digital fraudulence: SWAPNO's cash-for-work Public Works Program allows its
participants to deposit a percentage of their wages in a mobile wallet, which they receive after the
project is completed. However, 16 beneficiaries from Jamalpur heard about the hacking of their MFS
accounts through which they lost their savings of BDT 2,86,500.00 (USD 3370.59). The project acted
immediately and got the Bangladesh Counterterrorism and Cyber Crime Unit to handle the case. As
an immediate result of this initiative, 13 criminals were arrested, and the Cyber Crime Team
recovered the amount and handed over the money to the beneficiaries with the help of the Cyber
Crime Unit.
6.1.3 Physical Monitoring During COVID Pandemic: Regular field visits, physical verification,
spot-checking, and data quality control were a significant challenge to ensure error-free data and
smooth implementation of project activities because of the COVID-19 pandemic. To overcome these
shortcomings, the project immediately started remote/distance monitoring using WhatsApp/Viber.
Afterwards, Zoom meetings were introduced to communicate with communities and field colleagues
directly.
6.2
Lessons Learned
6.2.1 Ownership building of Local Government Division: The project has consciously invested
on “Ownership Building” with the Local Government Division, District and Upazila Administration
and the Union Parishad (UP) in various ways. These include extensive reporting, briefing and
meetings, involving them in decision making, accounts operation, and day-to-day project operation
management. The Central account is operated jointly by the National Project Director (NPD) and
the National Project Manager (NPM), the district account is jointly used by the Deputy Director of
Local Government (DDLG) and District Manager (DM), while the UP Account is operated by three
signatories: the UP Chair, Chairperson of the concerned Standing Committee-a female member of
UP and the Secretary. This ownership building strengthened the smooth implementation of the
project, ensured accountability and transparency, and achieved the results.
6.2.2 Ownership Building of Community People: Community involvement is embedded in the
project through the contribution of road maintenance materials such as soil gathered from
homesteads, protection and monitoring of SWAPNO women at work in public places, and
supervision of the beneficiary selection process. This involvement builds community ownership and
helps establish reciprocal accountability and a participatory monitoring process.
6.2.3 Use of Digital Platforms: COVID-19 has opened new opportunities for using digital
platforms – particularly digital tools like Zoom meetings, WhatsApp, etc. These tools saved time,
ensured better monitoring and remote implementation, and reduced exposure to the COVID-19 risks.

7. SUSTAINABILITY AND EXIT STRATEGY
SWAPNO has involved local and national institutions to achieve sustainable outcomes beyond
project tenure. The community people, local government institutions and development partners
owned the project since they have engaged in every step of the project implementation.

7.1 Community-level sustainability: SWAPNO advocated Union Parishads and local government
representatives and officials in order to continue to support SWAPNO’s beneficiaries after their
graduation. This has been done through district-level workshops where project outcomes were shared
with Union Parishad Chairpersons, Agriculture Extension Officers, Livestock Officers, Women
Officers and Youth Development Officers at the sub-district level, as well as Bank Managers, Deputy
Commissioners and other important government officials at the district level. The project provided
support for: i) women’s enterprises and linking them to market suppliers; ii) training women on
additional vocational skills and providing access to financial support; and iii) protecting women from
sexual and gender-based violence.
Similarly, SWAPNO has developed partnerships with local NGOs to continue their support to the
women beneficiaries even after phasing out of the project.
7.2 Institutional and financial sustainability: SWAPNO model is already embedded within a
national social protection framework. Backed by proven development impact, as part of ongoing
NSSS reforms, it has been incorporated into the Government’s Action Plan for scale-up across 10
districts. The Medium-Term Budgetary Framework (MTBF) 2018-19, published by the Ministry of
Finance, also highlighted estimates of allocations that LGD plans to set aside for SWAPNO II in the
next phase.
7.3 Policy-level sustainability: SWAPNO has successfully piloted and scaled up digital wage
payments (i.e. social transfers that the Government pays to the women) through mobile transfers and
agent banking. This intervention is linked with Social Security Policy Support programme—the
Government’s lead initiative on NSSS reforms.
7.4 Sustainability of project results: the results of the SWAPNO model have proven to be sustainable
at least in the medium-term period. The BIDS Evaluation Report also revealed the sustainability of
the project’s result. SWAPNO beneficiaries are doing quite well in terms of maintaining their
individual and collective income-generating activities. Beneficiaries employed in the formal sector
have also sustained their jobs with the garments factories. The formation of the cooperative society
by the beneficiaries and registration with the government bodies has given a new dimension to local
employment and sustainable graduation. Beneficiaries are presently actively involved with more

than two types of income-generating activities even after the project completion. It indicated the
sustainability of beneficiary’s learning they have been applying to IGAs. The level of aspiration about
beneficiaries themselves and their children’s future has increased significantly compared to the
control households which indicates the level of self-confidence that boosts the interest in fighting
poverty, it is expected that they would continue to grow and develop more in the future.

9. CONCLUDING SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
SWAPNO project has substantially changed the lives of 12,492 distressed rural women
of Bangladesh. The project has acted as a profound platform that served the
expectations of both parties – Local Government and vulnerable rural women which
ultimately contributes to poverty reduction, gender equality, socio-economic
empowerment, and climate resilience. Correct targeting, inclusive participation of all
stakeholders, training, and follow-up support – all these measures have contributed to
achieving this success. BIDS endline evaluation 2022 illustrated that the persistent
poverty trap syndrome could be overcome with the injection of threshold amount of
external resources. This is in contrast to the tokenism that characterizes conventional
social protection projects. Considering the success of the project, BIDS has suggested
the following measures for future implications:

• The project should be implemented in other remote areas of Bangladesh so that
people can come out of extreme poverty. SWAPNO model can also be
replicated in urban areas of poverty-stricken districts.

• To accommodate more penurious women under the SWAPNO coverage, the
number of beneficiaries in each ward can be increased.

•

In line with the present market rate and cost of living, per-day wages can be
increased so that the beneficiaries can invest more money in their regular IGAs
as well as avail improved living standards.

• The daily compulsory savings amount can also be set to a higher limit so that
the beneficiaries can save more and secure their future need.

Case Story
Case Story: I
Vocational Skills and Decent Working Opportunities
Skills development is one of the most important components of SWAPNO to uplift
vulnerable women from the poverty trap. To engage the women in various formal jobs,
SWAPNO delivers accredited industry skills to its beneficiaries by partnering with the
formal sectors, especially with the RMG and the Leather sector.
The project initiates the formal employment following a concreate screening guideline
to identify eligible women among the beneficiaries followed by a pre-job motivational
session to make them understandable and sensitized about the formal sector
employment. The sessions are conducted in collaboration with the relevant employer at
the community level.
Women can directly
interact
with
the
employers and learn
details about vocational
training,
eligibility
criteria,
pre-training
preparation,
employment facilities,
etc.
Based on the export
potentiality, generating
the highest number of
jobs for women and
sectoral annual growth,
SWAPNO identified the
skills gap of women workers in RMG and Leather sectors that are the most vibrant
sectors in Bangladesh. SWAPNO has developed cost-sharing partnerships with exportoriented green factories such as Ecofab Ltd, Green Smart Shirt Ltd and skills providing
organizations like the Center of Excellence for Leather Skills (COEL) to transfer
industrial skills and placement in jobs after assessing their learning.
After delivering a two-month-long Sewing Machine Operation training, the factories of
both RMG and Leather sectors placed the women as operators. So far about 588 women
have received jobs in factories primarily located in Gazipur.
Apart from this, to ensure a gender-sensitive decent working environment, the project
established a tripartite partnership among SWAPNO, the Center of Excellence for
Leather Skills in Bangladesh (COEL) and Leather goods and Footwear Manufacturing
Exporter Association of Bangladesh (LFMEAB) and developed a toolkit on Decent
Work Environment has been developed to sensitize and build awareness of the
factories’ personnel in the Leather Sector.

Case Story: II
Meena builds a better future for her children

It is perhaps impossible to imagine what goes through a mother when poverty drives
her to put her children in an orphanage to ensure food for them. But that’s exactly what
happened with the mother of four, Meena Begum. This 36-year-old woman from
Gaibandha sold everything she owned to treat her husband whom she eventually lost
due to throat cancer.
What lays ahead was years of misery and impoverishment that working in people’s
households could not compensate. Meena’s tragedy ended, however when her journey
at SWAPNO began. She used to earn BDT 4500 (USD 52) a month before. Then, after
being trained in small business, tailoring and livestock management, Meena makes
BDT 12000 (USD 140) every month. With the savings from Rotating Savings
Association, she has established an agricultural input buying-selling shop. This is a
shop of selling farmers’ produced vegetables, seeds, fertilizers as well as food items.
Apart from her regular income, this shop has increased her income by BDT 30,000
(USD 348) per month.
“Initially people mocked me for setting up the shop. After seeing the success, now
everyone encourages me that I have made a good decision by starting this business,”
– she said with a smile.
Knowledge of nutrition, leadership, and disaster management broadened Meena’s
outlook. Her children have started going to school now. In the future, Meena plans to
expand her current business to ensure proper education for her children.
Mina’s life testifies that hard work and perseverance always pay off. No matter what
the situation prevails, women like Mina always fight to bring a positive change in

their lives and SWAPNO, as a poverty graduation project, is proudly supporting them
in their development journey.
Case Story: III
Kollyani Sanitary Napkin: ending Period poverty in rural communities

In Bangladesh, stigma and social taboos around menstruation are still strong. As per
National Hygiene Survey 2020, 50 percent of adolescent girls and 65 percent of adult
women use old cloth during their menstrual time in Bangladesh. Almost half of all
adolescents in secondary schools have not received any lessons on menstrual hygiene
from school.
SWAPNO beneﬁciaries from Kurigram came forward with an idea to produce low-cost
sanitary napkins for poor rural families. There are 5000 beneﬁciaries who have just
broken out of the extreme poverty threshold. But still, many women in Kurigram can’t
aﬀord sanitary pads.
The project facilitated the graduated women of Kurigram Sadar Upazilla to establish a
cooperative and formed an enterprise to sustain their livelihood. The enterprise took the
lead to produce low-cost sanitary pads aiming to oﬀer aﬀordable health hygiene
solutions for the poor and create employment across the production and supply chain.
The cooperative has trained and recruited 5 beneﬁciaries in each Union as sales agents
and community volunteers who raise awareness of menstrual hygiene and sell door to
door in the village.
50 beneﬁciaries in 10 unions work as sales agents cum volunteers. So far, the enterprise
has reached seven to eight thousand adolescent girls and women, sold about 70,000
packs of sanitary napkins, and created 37 jobs for women in the last 12 months.

Case Story: IV
Micro-health Insurance: Rebuilding The Confidence of The Destitute
Health risks are generally
regarded by distressed
rural women as the most
costly risks among all
other natural, social, and
economic risks, making
micro-health insurance
essential.
SWAPNO
commissioned the Birla
Institute of Management,
India, to study Microhealth insurance for the
extreme poor in February
2020.
Socio-economic
status,
income
and
expenditure
patterns,
perception
and
understanding
of
insurance risks, insurance
premium affordability,
risk mitigation measures
of potential micro-insurance clients, and other issues and constraints related to access
to micro-insurance services were identified in the study.

The study also confirmed common features of the SWAPNO beneficiaries; suggested
suitable micro-insurance products to tackle vulnerability with an identified potential
insurer. Based on the study, the project piloted two micro health insurance policies,
SWAPNO Surokkha Policy and SWAPNO Shathi Policy, in association with Green
Delta Insurance and Micro-Fintech. SWAPNO Surokkha Policy includes the financial
benefits of accidental death and hospital coverage. Swapno Shathi Policy includes the
financial benefits of accidental death, and in-patient and out-patient hospital coverage.
The insurance has covered 1620 women beneficiaries of 5 Upazilas of Jamalpur district.
Micro Health Insurance coverage has provided the beneficiaries with the financial
support which is being incurred for the hospitalization or in-house treatment; without
this financial support, the poor beneficiaries would have been left with the treatment
from the quack doctors of the neighborhood.
